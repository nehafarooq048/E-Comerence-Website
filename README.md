# E-Comerence-Website

A simple e-commerce website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project demonstrates the structure of a modern online store, including product display, shopping cart functionality, wishlist, billing, user account management, and more.
This is a frontend-only project.
All pages (cart, wishlist, login, billing, etc.) are static UI representations showing how a real e-commerce platform would look.
